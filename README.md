# Coding Project: Multilingual Music Sharing

This is a coding project I made using Node.js and React.js to hone my skills in app development, content filtering, and integrating multiple APIs. This project uses the Google Cloud Translation API, the Spotify Web API, and the Genius Lyrics API to translate song lyrics into different languages, save user preferences and generate playlists. 

It is still a work in progress and the updates I'm working on right now are an actual frontend and some more translation-based integrations for a better user experience.
